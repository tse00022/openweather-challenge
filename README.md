# Project WeatherWhisper
This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project for [OpenWeather Challenge](https://challenge.openweather.co.uk/)

WeatherWhisper is an innovative weather app that combines a sleek dashboard displaying real-time weather and forecasts with a built-in voice assistant. Simply ask "How's the weather?" and WeatherWhisper will respond instantly, keeping you informed without the need to manually check your device.

Inspired by the unpredictable weather in Ottawa and the opportunity to repurpose old mobile phones, WeatherWhisper transforms these devices into dedicated weather stations. The app is designed to run on any mobile platform, ensuring users can access its features on-the-go and stay up-to-date with the latest weather information.
